## Installation

To get started with Tailwind CSS in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Tailwind CSS via npm:**

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss
    ```

2. **Create a Tailwind configuration file:**

    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init
    ```

    This will create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project.

3. **Configure your template paths:**

    In your `tailwind.config.js` file, add the paths to all of your template files so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles in production:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        './src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
        './public/index.html',
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```

4. **Add Tailwind to your CSS:**

    Create a CSS file (e.g., `src/index.css`) and add the following lines:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

5. **Include your CSS file in your project:**

    Make sure to include your newly created CSS file in your project, for example in `src/index.js`:

    ```js
    import './index.css';
    ```
